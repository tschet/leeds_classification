# Leeds Classification Feeds Importer #
A submodule of Leeds Classification, this adds a Feeds importer. This importer 
can be used to re-import the Classification terms, adding Feeds Guid values 
that can then be referenced by other feeds importers. This module is not 
required, but can be helpful.

All credit for the system goes to the team at Leeds. All mistakes in this 
usage of the system are mine.
